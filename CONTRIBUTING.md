# How to contribute

If you haven't already, come find us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/CgvvgDU).
Connecting with other contributors is a good way to identify pitfalls and ramp
up on reverse engineering progress more quickly. Developers in particular may
also want to consider joining the [GGPO Discord](https://discord.gg/xYB2Cdq).

## Testers and players: Submitting bugs

**Please do**:
* Submit issues when you find a bug! Our [issue template](https://github.com/adanducci/GGPOPLUSR/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
  has a good checklist of things to include when submitting an issue. Issue
  reports without a complete description may be rejected outright.
* Include video evidence when sending issues! Video is extremely helpful
  for both describing and reproducing issues. If you have the computing
  resources to spare, you may want to consider recording tests with
  [OBS](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) or another screen-recording
  solution.

**Please do not**:
* Submit feature requests. As players, we already have a lot of features in mind-
  to the point where we could work on this project as if it was a full time job.

## Developers: Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to @adanducci's repo](https://github.com/adanducci/GGPOPLUSR/pull/new/master)
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
