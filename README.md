## Building

GGPOPLUSR uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a build engine. This is
completely irrelevant to players, but developers will need an installation
of CMake, or IDE support for CMake, like Visual Studio.

Many development tools also rely on [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).
While it's not strictly necessary, developers may find it useful to have
Python installed and available from their system path, particularly for
prototyping new tools.

To build and run GGPOPLUSR:
1. Clone the following dependencies, which are built from source:
   * [GGPO](https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo)
   * Microsoft's [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours). Detours
     is used to install custom netplay hooks at runtime.
   * [ValveFileVDF](https://github.com/TinyTinni/ValveFileVDF). ValveFileVDF
     is used to parse Steam's configuration files, to automatically detect
     your installation of Guilty Gear.
   * [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Dear Imgui is used to
     provide custom overlays for new features and debugging.
2. Build GGPO and Detours using x86-compatible build tools.
   * GGXXAC+R is natively compiled for 32-bit x86, and using an entire 32-bit
     toolchain prevents us from needing to handle cross compilation.
   * GGPO and Detours are large enough that they benefit from precompilation-
     you won't need to precompile ValveFileVDF and Dear Imgui.
3. Use Visual Studio (or your preferred CMake generator) to generate a new
   CMake cache. Remember to update your CMake directories:
   * The `DETOURS_DIR` Cmake variable should point at your Detours build output
   * The `VALVEFILEVDF_DIR` CMake variable should point at your ValveFileVDF checkout.
   * The `DEARIMGUI_DIR` CMake variable should point at your Dear Imgui checkout.
4. Build the launcher using the makefile or project generated by CMake.
5. Confirm that `Launcher.exe` and `Sidecar.dll` are in the build output.
6. Run `Launcher.exe`.

## Why GGPO? Why +R? Why now?
While lockstep netcode was considered industry standard for many years
(including triple-A titles like _Street Fighter IV_), its failures have
been severe and widespread (_Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3_ and _King of
Fighters XIII_).

In the last decade, many prominent fighting-game developers have documented
the negative player effects that lockstep netcode and its necessary input
latency create. Instead, developers and community members alike have
espoused the virtues of rollback-based netcode, including
[Mike "MikeZ" Zaimont of Lab Zero and Skullgirls](https://mikezsez.blogspot.com/2019/11/lets-talk-about-rollbacks.html),
[Michael Stallone of Netherrealm and Mortal Kombat](https://youtu.be/7jb0FOcImdg),
and [Adam "Keits" Heart of Iron Galaxy and Killer Instinct](https://twitter.com/thekeits/status/1143897723848003584?lang=en).

GGXXAC+R uses an engine that was built on lockstep netcode, before
rollback-based netcode became more common in fighting games.

While in some cases +R's netcode can hold up relatively well, playing with
community members from across a country (or across an ocean!) is a
poor experience. Fortunately, thanks to GGPO's open-source release in October
2019, adapting a game to rollback-based netcode no longer requires modifying
the game _and_ writing an entire netcode implementation. This opens up the
possibility for fighting games new and old to be brought up to a new gold
standard- including this project.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome! While we're certainly seeking help
with C++ development, x86 assembly, Win32 APIs, reverse engineering, and
networking code, we need many non-technical skills as well! **You, the reader,**
